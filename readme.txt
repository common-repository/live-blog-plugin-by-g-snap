== Installation ==

- Download and unzip the plugin in the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.

- Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

- To start live blogging, go to http://gsnap.com and create your live event.  Once you've done that, take note of the ID in the browser bar, e.g.:

gsnap.com/your_gsnap_login/id

- Next, start a new post on your blog and add the shortcode, like this:

[snaplet id="1234" width="350" height="550"]

where 1234 should be replaced with the ID of your event.  You can also adjust the width and height from the default to whatever best suits your design.  

- Once you publish your post, your viewers will be able to see your live blog.  In order to run your live blog, stay on the event console on gsnap.com.  The console provides you with all the tools necessary to make for a successful event.
